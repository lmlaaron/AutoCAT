#the problem here i see is that the attacker can only infer one data at a time. for example here, the attacker will prime 00 and
#can infer that this line was accessed by the victim. but with this, he actually will write the value 00 in place of 02 which
#was not accessed by the victim. so the attacker might make a mistake. 
# so the attacker will measure the time for accessing all values in a set.
